# AnimalDetection

A repo for detecting animals!

##To do
- Code that can handle any file (regardless of name)
- Do we need to add more formats? Only handling .dav and .mp4 currently.
- Code that can run "headless," without displaying the video in real time (this will be faster).
- Probably plot code should be separated from main.
- How do we programatically locate regions in time where there is high-levels of activity?
- Can we write code to view just that portion of the relevant video?
- Can we write code that does object detection on the video regions of interest?
- Where do we store the videos? Drive doesn't seem to be a good option, AWS/S3?
